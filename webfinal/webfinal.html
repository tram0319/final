<div id="tips" style="display: none;">
   <div class="tip1">
  <h3>If you want good weather?</h3>
  <p>Between March and May is quite steady and consistent across the whole country with medium-high temperature and very little rain.
 . Humidity is higher in the North (such as Hanoi, Halong Bay, Sapa) and Center ( such as Hue, Danang, Hoi An) 
 than in the South (such as Ho Chi Minh City, Nha Trang, Mekong Delta) but in general more pleasant than the rest of the year. The period from October-early December is cooler than the former,
  in the Northern part of Vietnam. However the low humidity totally makes up for the fewer hours of sunshine: you will get cool breeze
 throughout the day, with some cities such as Hanoi being said to be at its best at this time of the year. There may be more rain as you travel south-ward, but the tempt is also 
 higher and rain comes and goes quickly. If you spend the majority of time in the central region of Vietnam, March-May may be a better period as there are significantly fewer 
 chances of downpours.  </p>
   </div>
   <div class="tip2">
  <h3>If you are mostly interested in beach escape?</h3>
  <p>Tour in January or April-May is perfect. In January, your can pick Southern beaches such as Nha Trang, Vung Tau and Phu Quoc. In April-May, you can pick 
 Northern and Central beaches such as Cat Ba Island, Thuan An, An Bang, My Khe or Ly Son Island. The reason to plan your beach visit during these two periods is not just 
 the temperate weather, low rain-fall, clear sky and gentle wind, but also because the beach is largely empty and perfect for your vacation. </p> 
  </div>
  <div class="tip1">
  <h3>If you want to experience festivals?</h3>
  <p> Plan your trip for December - March is pefect time.The period from late December up until March is a continuum of cultural events, both the Western-inspired 
   and the thousand-year-traditions.  </p>
   </div>
   <div class="tip2">
   <h3>If you want to offer your family the best holidays?</h3>
   <p>Consider March-May or November.The weather is calmest and the traffic is most acceptable. Spring is in full force from March and your kids will be just happy seeing the 
   tropical flowers in full bloom.</p>
    </div>
	<div class="tip1">
   <h3>If you want to avoid the crowd?</h3>
   <p>Plan your tour in late December - mid January, June-August weekends off your table. The best case scenario if you only have these months to spare: visit during the 
   weekdays instead.</p>
   </div>
 <div class="tip2">
   <h3>If you want great deals?</h3>
   <p> May and September are your friends.In terms of weather, May and September are quite pleasant to begin with. We lower the prices during these two months
 to attract more visits and balance out our annual revenue sheet, which means you can save about 30% compared with peak tourist season.</p>
